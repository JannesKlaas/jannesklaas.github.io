I am a machine learning focused researcher with a background (and interest) in economics. I see markets as a "petri dish" in which artificial intelligence can develop under competitive pressure. On this blog, I primarily write technical tutorials as well as personal blog entries. All posts are written by me and do not represent the views of my employer or any other organization I am affiliated with.
