This post is meant to share my summaries efficiently with my classmates. If you are coming to this webpage not knowing what the MFE is: It is an [MSc Program in Financial Economics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-financial-economics?wssl=1), and these notes are study notes for the core exams of the degree. **They are written by me, not part of the MFE, not endorsed by Oxford University or the Sa√Ød Business School and do not fully reflect the content taught in the MFE. They might contain mistakes.**

You can download them here:
- [Economics (MT and HT)](../assets/MFE/Econ_Summary.pdf)
- [Corporate Finance (MT and HT)](../assets/MFE/CoFin_Summary.pdf)
- [Econometrics (MT and HT)](../assets/MFE/Metrics_Summary.pdf)
- [Asset Pricing (MT)](../assets/MFE/Asset_Pricing_MT_Summary.pdf), [Asset Pricing (HT)](../assets/MFE/Asset_Pricing_HT_Summary.pdf)

If you find mistakes in my notes or think they are lacking an important part, please email me at jannesklaas [at] me [dot] com, **feedback is highly appreciated**.
